    This is the custom summary for the post.

    It can be in **markdown format** if required.

This is the text for the post. It won't be used as the excerpt as it will use the custom summary set in the post instead. 

If the summary is not set it will use the default excerpt generated by Jekyll.

To use a custom summary, set the `summary` in the post's front matter. 

```yaml
layout: post
title: Example post with a summary
summary: |-
    This is the custom summary for the post.

    It can be in **markdown format** if required.
```
